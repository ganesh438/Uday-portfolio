# 🧠 Data Science Using Python – Final Project

## 📌 Problem Statement
Analyzed a real-world dataset using Python to extract insights, engineer features, and build predictive models for improved classification accuracy and decision-making.

## 🧠 Approach
- Cleaned and preprocessed 10,000+ data rows using Pandas and NumPy.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, outliers, and trends.
- Applied feature engineering and scaling to prepare data for modeling.
- Built multiple classification models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
Jupyter Notebook | EDA | Feature Engineering | ML Modeling | Evaluation Metrics

## ✅ Key Results (Quantified)
- Achieved **87% accuracy** with Random Forest classifier.
- Improved **recall by 20%** over baseline logistic regression model.
- Identified top 5 influential features contributing to prediction outcome.
- Reduced data imbalance impact using stratified sampling techniques.
