# 🧠 Data Science Using Python – Final Project

## 📌 Problem Statement
Apply end-to-end data science techniques to analyze a real-world dataset and generate actionable insights using Python.

## 🧠 Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering and Transformation
- Predictive Modeling using Machine Learning Algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)
- Visualization of findings and model performance

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Science Techniques: EDA, Feature Selection, Model Building, Evaluation Metrics

## ✅ Outcome
- Built predictive models with high accuracy.
- Identified key features influencing the target variable.
- Presented actionable insights through visualization.

## 📁 Files
- `Data_Science_Using_Python_group_7_FinalProject.ipynb` – Full analysis and modeling notebook

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance
- Deployment of the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
